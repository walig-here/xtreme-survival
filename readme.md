# X-TREME SURVIVAL: Minecraft datapack
X-Treme Survival is my hobby project where I aim to create a Minecraft data pack which aim is to enhance the game's vanilla, survival experience. The whole idea was inspired by a great Minecraft modification 'Better than Wolves' which was created and maintained by FolwerChild until the year 2021.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES
While working on this project I'm following several design principles related to new features and overall gameplay. Their primary purpose is to maintain cohesion between features that would be implemented over time as well as give players enjoying and satisfying experience that's based on a set of fair, understandable rules.

### 1) Painful deaths
Gameplay should encourage players to avoid baseless deaths at all costs. Thus a punishment for dying must be painful enough to achieve said goal. Pararerly not dying for a while should reward players with more and more satisfying gameplay and a sense of progression.

### 2) Insomnia
There would be no option to easily skip dangerous nights. 

### 3) Limited resources
The resources and beauties of all three dimensions are not limitless nor indestructible. Players should be aware of that to survive and prosper. In other cases, they will doom themselves along with the environment.

### 4) Form caveman to cosmos
Gameplay should be based on a tech tree that would lead players from hard, dangerous, harsh rock-age survival to peaceful, full-automated and comfortable life.

### 5) There are worlds to explore and conquer!
Datapack should encourage players to explore and make three of the game's dimensions more hospitable places.

### 6) Extend the lore
The data pack will introduce a story of the world given to the player by using the environmental storytelling method. There would not be any full-blown, linear plot with dialogues, quests and cutscenes but subtle hints revealing the story to the player.

### 7) Medieval, fantasy style
Contents of the data pack should stick to Minecraft's semi-medieval, fantasy stylistics. No modern-styled features allowed!

### 8) No new dimensions, creatures and biomes
The data pack would not add any new dimensions, bioms and creatures. It would only extend those already existing in vanilla.
